            "Inspired by the wonderful work of [Kira McLean](https://codewithkira.com/clojure-tidy-tuesdays/), I have started some data notebooks to participate in *Tidy Tuesdays*, a collective project in the `R`community."
            "These notebooks are primarily enabled by people like [Daniel Slutsky](https://github.com/daslu) and many others who are working to develop comprehensive tools for engaging with data through `Clojure`."
            "As is the case in Kira's project, one of my goals here is to explore and learn those tools better."
            "## About Me"
            "My name is Eoin, I also have a personal blog at [spool-five.com](https://spool-five.com). In my free time I like to try learn as much as I can about `Clojure` and, more recently, data science. My background is in philosophy and my day job is administration."]))
